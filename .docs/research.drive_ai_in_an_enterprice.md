# Driving AI in an Enterprise
Research on how to drive AI in an enterprise from zero to hero.

## Introduction
In this research space, we look an objective look at how to transform an enterprise from scratch to incorporate artificial intelligence effectively into enterprise models.

As of the time of this research project, this particular field isn't well document. Thus the need for this research project.

## Table of Contents
|| Item | Description |

| 1. | [Foundations of AI](./design.use_cases.md) | Understand what's possible by means of AI and typical use cases.

## Disclaimer
Any and all information documented here is incorporating our novel ideas into some dispurse information found all over the internet. For this reason, this research space can serve as a foundational strategy to drive AI in your organization but should not be considered a "one shoe fits all" stategy for all enterprises.

## Rough Notes
AI In The Organization
- Determine AI competence of the organization
	- Get value
		- Which are the correct projects to work on?
		- Feasibility
			- Business process optimization
				- Find efficiencies
				- Reduce cost
				- Generate revenue
			- Employee productivity
			- Customer service
	- Get multiple people involve
		- Not in isolation. Involve other business units
	- Come up with standards
	- Determine skills required
		- Critical capability framework
	- Deploy models
		- Measure impact to prove value.
	- Considerations
		- Cater for technical and non-technical people to enable AI across the org. We dont want to shut people out. Enable everyone to work on AI really fast. - interdisciplinary collaboration
		- Make sure you can deploy models at scale
			- Monitor model decay
			- Monitor data pipelines
		- Make sure there is governance
			- Quality
			- Regulations
			- Company standards
			- Best practises
		- Get some quick wins to show the rest of the organization what's possible (the playground area in our platform)
		- You want to allow decisions to be made from the bottom up too (not just top-down).
			- This should allow for augmenting capabilities which
			- Empowers resrouces to do their job(s) better.
		- Culture
			- Data-driven
				- Ability to access data in realtime around to clock in order to make decisions at scale, fast.
			- Empower and include all emplyees to use AI.
			- Responsibility / ethics.
			- The above needs to be driven by leaders down to everyone.

- Model the enterprise.
- MLOps
	- SDLC
- Learning Paths
	- Examples / Libraries
	- YouTube Playlist(s) / channels
	- Udemy Learning Paths
	- AI plan for the organization.
- Data Mesh architecture.
- What can AI solve?
	- Math
	- Pattern recognition
	- Automation
- What drives AI success?
	- Quality data / data strategy / data engineering
	- Analytics / measuring things
	- Data science / machine learning to improve decision making
		- Scalability
		- Latency
		- Requirement for use cases
	- Capability & Culture
		- Experimentation / this can clarify what we need to or can solve
			- Need a strategy in place to allow for good and rapid experimentation.

AI Web Platform:
- Use Cases (current and new requests)
	- Template fields
	- Auto-create / maintain DevOps work items
	- Use cases can link to the model registry to test model(s).
- Model Registry
	- Descriptions
		- Technical
		- Express how the model works in a very English, non-tech way
	- Versioning history
		- Stats for each version.
	- Performance stats
	- Data sources
		- Any PII
- Data Discovery / Monitoring
	- All data pipelines
	- Each pipeline visualized as a graph. Green circle if all good. Red if not.
- Playground & Research
	- Example implementation of something / perhaps an iframe to a databricks notebook.
- Learning & Development
	- YouTube Channels
	- Udemy courses / workday courses
	- Articles by internal employees / markdown system
